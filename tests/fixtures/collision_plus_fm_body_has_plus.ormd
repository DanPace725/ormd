+++

Body content with some pluses:
```diff
+ Added line
++ Further details
```
This should be parsed correctly.
The `+++` above should not be mistaken for new front-matter or metadata.
What about a line that is just +++?
+++
The parser should treat this as body content because it's not `+++meta` or `+++end-meta`.
And `+++ meta` (with a space) should also be body content.
+++ meta
This is not a valid meta start.
Same for `+++ end-meta` (with a space).
+++ end-meta
This is not a valid meta end.
Only `+++meta` or `+++meta id` and `+++end-meta` (no trailing characters) are special.
