# Project Alpha - Implementation Progress Notes

**Date**: September 19, 2025  
**Meeting**: Daily Standup  
**Confidence**: Exploratory (early implementation, issues being discovered)

---

## Progress Summary {#progress-summary}

[[completed-work]] Work completed since last update:

### Frontend Development
- ‚úÖ **OnboardingWizard Component**: Basic structure implemented
- ‚úÖ **Form Validation**: React Hook Form integration complete
- ‚úÖ **Progress Indicator**: Visual progress bar working
- ‚è≥ **Error Handling**: In progress, 60% complete
- ‚ùå **Mobile Responsive**: Not started yet

### Backend Development  
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints**: `/start` and `/step/:id` endpoints complete
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Onboarding sessions table created
- ‚è≥ **Validation Layer**: JSON schema validation 80% complete
- ‚ùå **Caching Layer**: Blocked (see issues below)

### Testing
- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests**: Frontend components covered
- ‚è≥ **API Tests**: Basic happy path tests written
- ‚ùå **E2E Tests**: Waiting for complete flow implementation

## Current Blockers {#current-blockers}

[[blocking-issues]] Issues requiring resolution:

### üö´ **Critical: Legacy Data Integration**
- **Problem**: Old customer data format incompatible with new schema
- **Impact**: Cannot test with real data, deployment at risk
- **Owner**: Backend team + Product
- **ETA**: Need decision by Friday

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **High: Performance Regression**
- **Problem**: API response times 300ms (target: 200ms)
- **Impact**: Not meeting charter performance goals
- **Cause**: Database queries not optimized as designed
- **Owner**: Backend team
- **Next Step**: Database query analysis session tomorrow

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium: Mobile Layout Issues**  
- **Problem**: Onboarding flow breaks on mobile devices
- **Impact**: Poor user experience on mobile
- **Owner**: Frontend team
- **Next Step**: Responsive design sprint next week

## Discoveries and Learnings

### Technical Insights
1. **Database Complexity**: Legacy integration more complex than anticipated
2. **Performance Reality**: Theoretical design vs. real-world performance gaps
3. **User Feedback**: Early testing shows users prefer shorter forms

### Process Insights
1. **Daily Check-ins**: Catching issues early through frequent communication
2. **Incremental Testing**: Small tests revealing big architectural issues
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Need more frequent product team sync

## Updated Timeline

Original timeline from [[charter-reference]] charter vs. current reality:

| Phase | Original | Current Status | New Estimate |
|-------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Requirements & Design | 2 weeks | Complete ‚úÖ | 2 weeks |
| Development & Testing | 6 weeks | Week 2 of 6 | **8 weeks** (+2 weeks) |
| Deployment & Monitoring | 2 weeks | Not started | 2 weeks |

**Total Project**: 10 weeks ‚Üí **12 weeks** (2-week extension needed)

## Risk Assessment

### New Risks Identified
- **Legacy Integration Complexity**: Higher than expected
- **Performance Tuning**: May require architecture changes
- **Mobile Experience**: Underestimated effort required

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Legacy Data**: Dedicated migration sprint with data team
2. **Performance**: Database consultant engagement approved  
3. **Mobile**: Bring in UX designer for mobile-specific review

## Next Steps (Next 3 Days)

### Thursday
- [ ] Database performance analysis session
- [ ] Legacy data format documentation review
- [ ] Mobile layout investigation

### Friday  
- [ ] Legacy integration decision meeting
- [ ] Performance optimization implementation
- [ ] Sprint retrospective and planning

### Monday
- [ ] Mobile responsive design sprint kickoff
- [ ] Updated timeline communication to stakeholders
- [ ] E2E test planning session

## Team Morale and Observations

**Positive**: Team is communicating well and catching issues early  
**Concern**: Timeline pressure building due to discovered complexity  
**Action**: Schedule team retrospective to address process improvements

## Meta-Notes

This document demonstrates the context layer in action:
- **Lineage Tracking**: Shows this builds on both technical design and charter
- **Confidence Level**: "Exploratory" reflects the uncertainty of early implementation
- **Source Attribution**: Links to daily standup meeting
- **Relationship Mapping**: Clear connections to foundational documents

When the next team member picks up this project, they can immediately understand:
- Where these notes came from (daily standup)
- What documents provide background context
- How much to trust the current status (exploratory confidence)

**Implementation continues with increased awareness of complexity...**
