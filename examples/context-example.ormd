# Context Layer Example Document

This document demonstrates the new **Context Layer MVP** features in ORMD 0.1. It shows how to use conversation lineage tracking and explicit uncertainty levels to improve context handoff between AI conversations and collaborative sessions.

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Lineage Tracking {#lineage-tracking}

This document includes [[lineage-example]] lineage information in its YAML front-matter:

```yaml
context:
  lineage:
    source: "example-creation-session"
    parent_docs: ["../docs/spec-0.1-context-extension.ormd"]
```

**Source Identification**: The `source` field identifies this document was created during an "example-creation-session". This could be:
- An AI conversation identifier
- A meeting or workshop name  
- A research session reference
- Any human-readable identifier

**Parent Documents**: The `parent_docs` array shows this document builds upon the context extension specification.

### Confidence Levels {#confidence-levels}

The [[confidence-explanation]] `resolution.confidence` field indicates this document has "working" confidence level:

- **`exploratory`**: Early ideas, brainstorming, uncertain conclusions
- **`working`**: Tested concepts with reasonable confidence ‚Üê *This document*
- **`validated`**: High confidence, thoroughly tested/reviewed content

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

### AI Conversation Handoff

```yaml
context:
  lineage:
    source: "claude-conversation-2025-09-19-session-1"
    parent_docs: ["requirements.ormd", "initial-research.ormd"]
  resolution:
    confidence: "exploratory"
```

When handing off context to a new AI session, the lineage provides:
- **Conversation continuity**: Next AI knows this came from a specific session
- **Background context**: Parent documents provide foundational information
- **Appropriate skepticism**: "exploratory" confidence suggests ideas need validation

### Meeting Documentation

```yaml
context:
  lineage:
    source: "sprint-planning-2025-09-19"
    parent_docs: ["previous-sprint-retro.ormd", "product-roadmap.ormd"]
  resolution:
    confidence: "working"
```

Meeting notes can reference:
- **Session identification**: Clear link to specific meeting
- **Preparatory materials**: Documents reviewed before the meeting
- **Decision confidence**: "working" suggests decisions were made but may need refinement

### Research Documentation

```yaml
context:
  lineage:
    source: "literature-review-session-3"
    parent_docs: ["survey-methodology.ormd", "preliminary-findings.ormd"]
  resolution:
    confidence: "validated"
```

Research documents can indicate:
- **Research session**: Which phase of research produced this
- **Prior work**: What previous research this builds on
- **Reliability level**: "validated" suggests peer review or thorough verification

## Backward Compatibility

This document works perfectly in ORMD parsers that don't support the context extension:
- The `context` block is simply ignored
- All other functionality works normally
- No validation errors or parsing failures

## Visual Indicators

Future renderers might display context information as:
- **Confidence badges**: üî¨ Exploratory | üîß Working | ‚úÖ Validated  
- **Lineage breadcrumbs**: Parent Document ‚Üí This Document
- **Source attribution**: "Created during: example-creation-session"

## Benefits Realized

Using this context layer approach:

1. **Context Preservation**: Future readers understand document origins
2. **Appropriate Confidence**: Explicit uncertainty prevents over-reliance on speculative content
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Clear connections between related documents
4. **Collaboration Enhancement**: Easier handoffs between team members or AI sessions

## Meta-Example

This very document demonstrates the concept:
- **Traces its lineage** to the specification document
- **Declares working confidence** - it's a tested example, not just theory
- **Identifies its source** as an example creation session
- **Links semantically** to the concepts it demonstrates

When you read this document, you immediately know:
- Where it came from (example creation session)
- What it builds on (the context extension spec)  
- How much to trust it (working confidence level)
- How it relates to other documents (semantic links)

**This concludes the Context Layer example. The format works!** üéâ
