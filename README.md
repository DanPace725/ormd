# ORMD (Open Relational Markdown)

> **Living, relational documents for humans and machines.**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

ORMD is a next-generation document format that combines the simplicity and ubiquity of Markdown with a relational metadata layer, verifiable provenance, and open packaging. Our goal is to empower authors and readers with documents that are:

* **Readable & writable** as plain text
* **Inspectable & editable** anywhere
* **Relational**—connect ideas semantically
* **Integrity-preserving** with digital signatures
* **Collaborative** and future-proof

This monorepo contains all you need to **spec**, **build**, and **demo** ORMD.
