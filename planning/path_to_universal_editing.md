You’ve laid out a very pragmatic, human-centered path—here’s what stands out to me and a few things to watch for:

---

## 1. Putting *all* metadata in YAML front-matter

**Why it rocks**

* **Universality:** Every Markdown tool understands front-matter, so even plain-text editors get syntax highlighting and folding.
* **Simplicity:** No more custom `+++meta` blocks to confuse newcomers—everything’s in one place .
* **Tool friendliness:** YAML libraries are everywhere; generating and validating fields becomes trivial.

**What to watch**

* **Front-matter bloat:** If you start embedding large CSVs or long asset lists there, the top of your document may become unwieldy. Consider namespace conventions (e.g. `assets:` vs. `contentHash:`) to keep it scannable.
* **Editor UX:** Some editors collapse front-matter by default; make sure users can easily see and edit critical fields without hunting through a long YAML block.

## 2. Auto-generation & “ormd update” commands

**Why it rocks**

* **Zero friction:** Authors don’t have to manually track word-counts, timestamps, hashes, etc.
* **Consistency:** Prevents drift between declared and actual values.
* **On-demand fixes:** `ormd fix` could even suggest missing fields or populate templates.

**What to watch**

* **Opt-out mechanism:** Some power-users may want to override auto-calculated fields—provide a clear way to “lock” front-matter entries.
* **Idempotency:** Ensure repeated runs of `ormd update` don’t shuffle the YAML order or introduce noise in version control diffs.

---

## 3. Validation as a first-class citizen

**Why it rocks**

* **Immediate feedback:** A file watcher / git hook means “Did I break my links?” is answered *before* review.
* **Universal integration:** Works in *any* editor via CLI, but shines with IDE plugins (red squiggles under `[[broken-link]]`) .

**What to watch**

* **Error messaging:** Make sure errors point to exact lines and include human-readable guidance (“Did you mean `#section-id`?”).
* **Performance:** For very large docs or many assets, incremental validation or a cache may be necessary to keep save-hooks snappy.

---

## 4. Phased asset-editing strategies

* **Inline CSV/data:** Lovely for small tables—just stick it in front-matter or fenced blocks.
* **External image refs:** Keeps YAML lean and lets authors swap out large media without editing the `.ormd` itself.

**What to watch**

* **Round-trip integrity:** If someone edits `./assets/chart.png` in their editor, `ormd pack` should detect the change automatically.
* **Fenced-block conventions:** Define clear rules for when assets go inline vs. external to avoid confusion.

---

## 5. Browser-based editing MVP

* **Bare-bones `<textarea>` + download:** Absolutely the fastest path to “edit in any browser.”
* **Progressive enhancements:** CodeMirror→File System Access API→collaboration layers make sense as a roadmap.

**What to watch**

* **Security:** If you offer sharing via URLs (e.g. `ormd.io/edit/abc123`), consider encryption or at least expiring links to protect private docs.
* **Sync/merge conflicts:** As multiple people edit, you’ll need a strategy (CRDT, locking, or 3-way merge) before calling it “collaborative.”

### Bottom line

This direction keeps the *happy path* extremely simple—edit a YAML header and Markdown body in Notepad or a browser—and then layers on auto-magic, validation, and richer UIs. That’s exactly what “Markdown with superpowers” should feel like.

If you’re ready for the big win, **Phase 1** (front-matter simplification + `ormd update` + basic validation) delivers the largest UX improvement with minimal effort. After that, you can build confidence before investing in editors, web apps, and collaboration features.

I’d say: sharpen your YAML schema next, define clear asset-naming conventions, and ship that first “auto-update” command. Once authors see their timestamps, word-counts, and links simply appear, you’ll have them hooked.
