# ORMD VSCode Extension Verification Report

## Goal
Verify the basic functionality of the `ormd-vscode` extension in a VSCode Extension Development Host, as per the subtask instructions.

## Actions Taken & Observations

1.  **Environment Preparation:**
    *   Navigated to the `ormd-vscode` directory.
    *   Attempted to prepare the environment for running a GUI application by installing `xvfb` (X Virtual FrameBuffer). This installation was successful.
    Command: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y xvfb`

2.  **Attempt to Launch Extension Development Host:**
    *   Attempted to launch the VSCode Extension Development Host using the command:
        `xvfb-run -a code --extensionDevelopmentPath=. --list-extensions --verbose . > vscode_launch_log.txt 2>&1 &`
    *   **Failure:** The command failed to execute. The primary error message captured in `vscode_launch_log.txt` (and displayed on stderr) was:
        `/usr/bin/xvfb-run: 184: code: not found`

3.  **Analysis of Failure:**
    *   The error `code: not found` indicates that the Visual Studio Code command-line interface (`code`) is not installed in the execution environment or is not accessible via the system's PATH.
    *   Without the `code` executable, the Extension Development Host cannot be launched.

4.  **Consequences for Verification:**
    *   Due to the inability to launch the VSCode Extension Development Host, the following verification steps outlined in the subtask could **not** be performed:
        *   Creating a `test.ormd` file within the host.
        *   Checking the language mode in the VSCode status bar.
        *   Checking the developer tools console for the extension activation message.
        *   Visually verifying syntax highlighting for YAML front-matter and ORMD links.
        *   Testing comment toggling functionality.

## Conclusion
The verification of the `ormd-vscode` extension's behavior within the VSCode Extension Development Host could not be completed because Visual Studio Code (`code` command) is not available in the provided environment. The setup of `xvfb` was successful, but the core application required for the test is missing.

Further verification would require an environment where VSCode can be successfully launched and interacted with. The previously compiled extension files (`out/extension.js`) are presumed to be correct based on the successful `tsc` compilation in the prior subtask.

**Summary of Feasibility:**
*   Step 1 (Navigate): Done.
*   Step 2 (Launch Host): Attempted, failed due to missing `code`.
*   Step 3 (Host Interactions): Not possible.
    *   3a-g: Not possible.
*   Step 4 (Document observations): This report.

## Addendum: Configuration Review (Static Analysis)

As interactive testing was not possible due to the absence of VSCode in the environment, a static review of the extension's configuration files was performed to assess their correctness based on the project setup instructions and common VSCode extension development practices.

**1. `package.json` Review:**
    *   **Activation:** `activationEvents` correctly includes `"onLanguage:ormd"`. This ensures the extension activates when an `.ormd` file is opened.
    *   **Language Contribution:**
        *   The `languages` contribution correctly defines `id: "ormd"`.
        *   `extensions` correctly lists `[".ormd"]`.
        *   `configuration` correctly points to `"./language-configuration.json"`.
    *   **Grammar Contribution:**
        *   The `grammars` contribution correctly specifies `language: "ormd"` (matching the language ID).
        *   `scopeName` is set to `"source.ormd"`, which is a standard convention.
        *   `path` correctly points to `"./syntaxes/ormd.tmLanguage.json"`.
    *   **Overall:** The `package.json` file appears to be correctly configured for basic language support, activation, and grammar association.

**2. `language-configuration.json` Review:**
    *   **Comments:** `comments.blockComment` is correctly set to `["<!--", "-->"]`, suitable for ORMD's Markdown-based syntax.
    *   **Brackets & Auto-Pairing:** Standard bracket pairs (`[]`, `()`, `{}`) are defined, along with appropriate `autoClosingPairs` (including for comments and quotes) and `surroundingPairs`.
    *   **Overall:** This file is well-configured for basic editing features like comment toggling and bracket handling.

**3. `src/extension.ts` Review:**
    *   **Activation Logging:** The `activate` function includes the line `console.log('Congratulations, your extension "ormd-vscode" is now active!');`. This message should be logged by the extension host upon successful activation.
    *   It also contains `vscode.window.showInformationMessage('ORMD VSCode Extension Activated');` for a user-visible notification.
    *   **Overall:** The `activate` function is correctly set up to log an activation message as required.

**4. `syntaxes/ormd.tmLanguage.json` Review:**
    *   **Front-matter Highlighting:** The `frontmatter` rule correctly uses `begin: "^---$"` and `end: "^---$"` to identify the YAML front-matter block. It appropriately uses `include: "source.yaml"` to delegate highlighting within this block to a standard YAML grammar.
    *   **ORMD Link Highlighting:** The `ormd-links` rule uses `match: "\\[\\[([^\\]]+)\\]\\]"` which accurately captures the `[[link-id]]` syntax. The scope `markup.underline.link.ormd` is assigned.
    *   **Fallback Highlighting:** The main `patterns` array includes `text.html.markdown`, ensuring that content not matched by specific ORMD rules can be highlighted as standard Markdown.
    *   **Overall:** The initial TextMate grammar provides a plausible and correct foundation for highlighting the key distinct parts of an ORMD document (front-matter, links) and falls back to Markdown for general content.

**Configuration Review Conclusion:**
The static review of the `ormd-vscode` extension's configuration files (`package.json`, `language-configuration.json`, `src/extension.ts`, and `syntaxes/ormd.tmLanguage.json`) indicates that they are correctly set up according to the initial development instructions and align with standard practices for VSCode language support extensions. These configurations should provide a solid basis for the intended features (activation, basic editing support, initial syntax highlighting) if the extension were run in a compatible VSCode environment.
