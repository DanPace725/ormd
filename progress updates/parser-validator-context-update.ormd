# Progress Update: Context Block Implementation

This document confirms the completion of the [[task-definition]] first task for the Context Layer MVP: adding full support for the `context` block to the ORMD parser and validator.

## Summary of Changes

The core logic of the `ormd-cli` has been updated to recognize, validate, and serialize the new `context` block in a backward-compatible manner.

### 1. Schema Enhancement ([[schema-changes]])

-   The official front-matter schema (`schema.py`) was updated with new dataclasses (`Context`, `Lineage`, `Resolution`) to define the structure of the `context` block.
-   Detailed validation logic was added to `FrontMatterValidator` to enforce the rules for the new fields (e.g., correct types, valid confidence levels).

### 2. Validator Update ([[validator-changes]])

-   The main `ORMDValidator` was updated to recognize `context` as a valid top-level key in the front-matter, preventing it from being flagged as an "unknown field."

### 3. Parser Update ([[parser-changes]])

-   The `serialize_front_matter` function was updated to ensure the `context` block is written in a consistent, logical order when ORMD files are saved.

### 4. New Tests ([[new-tests]])

-   A dedicated test file, `test_context.py`, was created to isolate and verify the new functionality.
-   The tests cover valid cases, invalid cases (e.g., bad confidence values, incorrect structure), and backward compatibility, ensuring that documents without a `context` block remain valid.
-   All new tests are passing.

### 5. New Documentation ([[new-documentation]])

-   A new documentation file has been created to explain the internal logic of the parser and validator, including how they now handle the `context` block.

## Conclusion

The foundational work for the Context Layer MVP is complete. The CLI can now correctly parse and validate documents that use the experimental `context` block. This paves the way for implementing the user-facing CLI commands (`ormd create --from-conversation`, etc.) that will leverage this new metadata.
