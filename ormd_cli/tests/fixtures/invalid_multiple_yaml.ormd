# Document Body

This document has a valid initial YAML front-matter block.

---
secondary_title: This is a problem
another_field: true
---

The YAML block above (starting and ending with `---`) should cause a parsing or validation error because only one YAML front-matter block is allowed at the beginning of the document.

+++
some_other_block: also problematic
+++

And this `+++` block too.
