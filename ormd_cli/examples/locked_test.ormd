# Test Document with Locked Fields

This document has some locked fields that should not be updated by the update command.

We have many more words here to test if the word count gets updated despite being locked. This paragraph has quite a few words to make the count significantly higher than the locked value of 50.

There are also some [[test-link]] references and ![image](assets/test.png) assets that should still be detected and updated since those fields are not locked.
