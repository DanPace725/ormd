# Simple Test Document

This is a test of the new single-file ORMD format. The [[intro-ref]] should link to the introduction section below.
Here, there, do an edit. 

## Introduction {#introduction}

This introduction explains the purpose of this test document. It demonstrates how semantic links work in the new format.

## Main Content

Here's some content that references our [[conclusion-ref]] to show bidirectional linking.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

This conclusion wraps up our test document and validates that the parsing works correctly.
