# Introduction

This is a test document for the [[intro]] section that references other sections like [[methodology]].

## Methodology

Here we have some methodology content that includes:

- A reference to an image: ![Climate Chart](assets/climate-chart.png)
- A reference to a PDF: [Report](assets/report.pdf)
- Some code blocks that should be excluded from word count:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

And here's some `inline code` that should also be excluded.

## Results

The results show interesting patterns. We also reference [[intro]] again here, and mention another asset: ![Data Visualization](assets/data-viz.svg).

This document has multiple paragraphs to test word counting. Each paragraph contains several words that should be counted properly when calculating the total word count.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this document tests:
1. Link ID extraction ([[intro]], [[methodology]])
2. Asset ID extraction (assets/climate-chart.png, assets/report.pdf, assets/data-viz.svg)
3. Word counting (excluding code blocks and inline code)
4. Timestamp generation for dates.modified
